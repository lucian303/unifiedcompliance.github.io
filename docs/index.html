<h3>Key Points for Getting Started with the API</h3>
<ul>
	<li>
		You must have a
		<a href="https://cch.commoncontrolshub.com/account-create.php">CCH Account</a> to use the API. The account can be either a starter account or one with a basic subscription.
	</li>
	<li>
		In order for a list to appear via the API, it must be
		<a href="https://support.commoncontrolshub.com/hc/en-us/articles/206693006-How-do-I-share-an-Authority-Document-list-">marked as "shared"</a>.
	</li>
	<li>
		UCF data is <em>only</em> accessible through
		<strong>Authority Documents Lists</strong>. For example, you cannot query for a list of all Common Controls, you must instead query for all Common Controls associated with a User's
		<strong>Authority Document List</strong>.
	</li>
