<h2>How the UCF Works</h2>
<p>Nobody thinks about compliance frameworks in terms of modularity – except the Unified Compliance team.</p>
<p>This is an "artist view" of the Unified Compliance Framework. It is built out as a suite of compliance
	<em>elements</em>, each of which perform a specific function to aid you in organizing your compliance content, interpreting your compliance content, or auditing your compliance content. Because the UCF is element-based, it can be rearranged or extended as needed.
</p>

<h2>Why have a framework at all?</h2>
<p>A framework is an extensible structure for describing a set of concepts, methods, and technologies as an integrated set of policies and procedures designed to assist organizations to achieve their goals and objectives. Frameworks have become a necessary means to distill and harmonize the various controls forced upon us because of the increasing number of regulatory guidelines burdening today’s organizations. It is not uncommon for a single mid-sized organization to fall under Gramm-Leach-Bliley, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, and multiple state and international privacy regulations. We covered the three steps you need to comply above. What a framework allows you to do to is to add one more step; de-duplication of effort. Any organization that falls under multiple regulatory guidelines will fall prey to overlapping Mandates (how many ways can you say “protect the information”?). Your compliance framework should not only cover how to organize your Authority Documents and interpret their Mandates, it should also provide a methodology for de-duplication of those Mandates as well as provide a methodology to add or clarify audit questions when they are unclear or missing. Therefore, a compliance framework is the structure you build around your compliance program so that you</p>
<ol>
	<li>know which Authority Documents to follow,</li>
	<li>interpret them so that you can communicate which Mandates must be followed,</li>
	<li>de-duplicate your efforts to whatever extent allowable, and</li>
	<li>provide an auditing methodology to prove their implementation.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Unified Compliance Framework provides you with the tools and methodologies to accomplish these four objectives.</p>
